# Hi there 👋, I'm Cris

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a **Full Stack Developer** passionate about building scalable, efficient, and maintainable applications.  
Currently, I'm working with **Laravel (PHP)**, **Node.js**, and **React**, constantly improving my skills to grow from a Mid-level to a Senior developer.

I enjoy solving problems, optimizing processes, and writing clean code that lasts.
